# Sprint 1 Report

**Video Link:** *TBD*

## What's New (User Facing)

- Implemented user sign-up functionality
- Implemented user login functionality
- Set up profiles table in Supabase
- Set up games table in Supabase
- Configured database with Supabase for future feature expansion

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

During this sprint, I focused on setting up the foundational authentication and database infrastructure for the project. Using Supabase as the backend, I implemented secure user authentication for sign-up and login. I also created database tables for storing user profiles and game-related data. The main challenge was configuring Supabase roles and permissions correctly to ensure data security while maintaining accessibility for the frontend. Another obstacle was debugging Supabase's authentication integration with Next.js, but thorough testing resolved these issues. This sprint laid a strong foundation for further development in future sprints.
