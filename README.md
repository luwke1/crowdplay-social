# Crowdplay

Crowdplay is a web app where you can browse games, write reviews, get personalized recommendations, and follow other players. I built it to practice full-stack development and see how AI could make recommendations feel more personal.

## Screenshots
![Recommendations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aabe019-291d-47c9-904a-e9bb3543ae87)
This page allows the user to generate recommendations, that can also be tailored to their reviews and ratings. The user also has the option to type in a prompt, such as "games set in the future," and using GeminiAPI, Internet Game Database API, and user review data, it can generate new video game recommendations. 

This is connected to IGDB API to pull in their proper game covers and allow users to view the games public reviews and information. 


![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e9285d5-c95b-42d1-88c1-37d863d0d471)
The main home page the user sees when they first login. They can browse games with search, or load more popular and latest games.

![Search](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a84558c9-41ba-416c-bd04-079d862555ef)
Users can search for games using the search bar in the header. It will display relevant games found in the IGDB database based on your query.

![Profile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9f6d25b-133d-4094-a9af-8212b707a6aa)
A user can visit their profile or another users and view all of their reviewed movies, and also how many followers/following they have. Users can also hover over a game card and remove ratings and reviews from their account.

![GameDetails](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1133506b-d756-412f-945f-1de960d75deb)
When a game is clicked, it brings up the game details and displays all the written reviews for the game. It also gives the user the option to leave their own rating and written review. This all interacts with the backend database created in Supabase.
